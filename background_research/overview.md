# General
Our idea for the 8 different pages is to have 8 seperate locations. These locations are going to be grouped into four groups of two.

## Groups:
1. Wildlife
    1. Beaver Damn
    2. Duckpond
2. History
    1. War Memorial Hall / Drillfield
    2. Blacksburg Mill
3. Water runoff
    1. Bridge 1
    2. Town Spring (or any spring, not too sure on this location)
        Option: Owens Street Spring- stormwater detention pond
4. Bioretention
    1. Smithfield Lot Bioretention Pretreatment/ Smithfield Lot Bioretention
    2. West End Bioretnetion
5. Other places to maybe include instead of biorentention
    1. ICTAS II Rain Garden 
    2. Roller Hockey Rink Water Quality Unit
