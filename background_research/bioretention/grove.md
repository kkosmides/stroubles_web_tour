extended detention: provides gradual release of water to increase settling pollutants and protect downstream channels from frequent storms
    When combined pond, pollutant settling time increased by 24 hours


Grove
    1. constructed in late 90s
    2. During construction, got overloaded with sediment and trash 
    3. Low flow channel to direct water to outlet
    4. inflow channel collects runoff parking lot into pond

    Pond underwent rehab:
        Replaced low flow outlet structure to handle runoff and volume better

        Went from muddy mess with sediment and debris to better looking area
